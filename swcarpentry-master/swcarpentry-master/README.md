# Welcome to Software Carpentry  





![](http://software-carpentry.org/assets/img/logo-blue.svg)






This is a meta repository to help navigate the numerous repositories and lessons of the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) community on GitHub.






## What is Software Carpentry
Software Carpentry is a community of volunteer instructors who teach short workshops and develop lessons which empower researchers of all disciplines to learn about and improve the ways in which they create software and collaborate.

## Code of Conduct

We are an open and inviting community with an actively enforced [Code of
Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/).  We value the involvement of
everyone in this community - learners, instructors, hosts, developers, steering
committee members and staff. We are committed to creating a friendly and
respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in
our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to
others.

## Run a workshop

For a fee, we can help you [bring a Software Carpentry workshop to your organization](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/). This fee
supports the ongoing work of our community to train instructors in all
disciplines and as a community support and develop the lessons that are needed
to improve researcher's skills and practices with regard to software and data.

## Get your organization to become a member

Our [member organizations](http://software-carpentry.org/scf/partners/) are
organizations that are [committed to supporting](http://software-carpentry.org/scf/join/) our organization so that they can
have local instructors trained annually. Members also take an active role in
helping to direct and support the sustainment and growth of the community.  

## Get involved

You can [get involved](http://software-carpentry.org/join/) with our community
by subscribing to our [newsletter](http://eepurl.com/cfODMH) joining our
[mailing lists](http://software-carpentry.org/join/#discussion) or coming to one
of our [community events/meetings](http://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar). Want to contribute to the lessons themselves, a list of our [open GitHub issues](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/dashboard/) is a good place to start and each of our lessons has a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) (example from `shell-novice`) that details how and what contributions are welcome. We use etherpads to manage much of our work and communications, we have an [etherpad of etherpads](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/pad-of-pads) to help you find things you're looking for.

## Lesson template

We maintain a set of CSS and Jekyll scaffolding that can be used to help organize and create lessons in our style ([swcarpentry/styles](https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles)). Instructions for how to contribute are in [swcarpentry/lesson-example](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example).

## Infrastructure project

We run a bunch of workshops every year, to coordinate all of our workshop activities we have been developing an open source tool called [AMY](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy). AMY is a Django application that helps us to manage our volunteer network and track when and where we will and have run workshops. It is an essential part of our day-to-day operations and is itself an open source project that welcomes contributions.

## Related projects

We work closely with the following projects and share community and instructor capacity:
* [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org)
* [Library Carpentry](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry)

## Experimental Lessons

These lessons were created as part of a contract to deliver advanced material. They've been taught a few times, but could benefit from some care and attention from the community. If you're interested in engaging with these lessons, please contact [Jonah Duckles](mailto:jduckles@carpentries.org)
